_I became interested in programming about 3-4 years when I realized that there are so many great opportunities in a technology 
world. Taking in consideration my background, I went to law school back in Russia and was always told that 
I have strong analytical skills, I decided to explore the languages on my own. I watched a few videos on YouTube and tried 
a few self paced learning programs. When I heard about Ada a few years ago and I read a history behind it, 
I got very interested in this organization. I really like the opportunity it gives the women and a chance to change their 
career and enter the technology world. Honestly where I am coming from growing up as a child computer developer was not 
even introduced or offered to me at all. I am still thinking why? I wish I was introduced to it as a child. 
Growing up my dad bought our first computer when I was young I Remember it was covered in a blanket and we could not touch it. 
Dad did not know how to use it so it was just sitting there. As I got older I got my own computer and remember using the 
floppy disk and when windows program was not even introduced back then. I remember the feeling liking to play with my 
computer and explore new features and just testing it. Since then I was never afraid of technology and that helped me a 
lot when I was working in a medical field where I had to learn a lot of programs and databases to do my job well.  
For the past few years I have been reading and doing some research on languages and watching tutorials on udemy, 
codeacademy and youtube. I have a few female friends who are developers and I talked to them and asked them questions 
about their experience and how they started and what they were recommended. A few of them refereed me to Ada website. 
In addition, I attended a few meet ups for women in technology and tried to learn as much about the industry. 
So far, I have taken on my own a computer science foundation class that covers basic java script. 
Additionally, I took HTML/CSS class. I attended free Django girls workshop that teaches you how to create your own web page, 
and took java script for beginner with “Women who code”._

_If selected for the Ada program, I’d be ever so grateful to your academy, as I am sure it would give me the necessary 
boost in making my dreams of becoming a software developer come alive. Upon completing of the program, 
I am hoping to land a job at one of the local IT companies and keep working incessantly on improving and perfecting 
my programming skills to get up to the level where I’d be able to take up different challenging technological projects 
on my own and hopefully opening a start-up that would benefit people that are in need. Judging from my experience 
there is so much to learn and grow in IT world, there is always new technology and things you can advance and master. 
To summarize my plan is to study and learn the languages that I need to use at my job and be good at it and give back 
when I have enough knowledge and experience to build something on my own or join a company that has a missing close 
to my heart, like Thorn company that stops the thread of child sexual abuse._

_I came to the United States over 13 years ago from Russia. At the age of 20 I ventured out to Seattle on my own 
to gain the invaluable skills and professional experience I would’ve never gotten otherwise back in my home-country. 
I started to work for a property injury law firm and had to learn almost everything from scratch, since the law system 
was and still is quite different in Russia and the US, especially in the legal field I was practicing in. 
Despite of overcoming various professional challenges, dealing with the culture shock, and overall getting situated in a 
new country, learning new technology and software always came very naturally to me. I strongly believe that my work 
experience in law, healthcare, and insurance fields of business will be helpful to me as a coder. I am bilingual, 
I speak English and Russian. Also, being a part of the Ada would help me as a mom to set a great example for my daughter. 
I want her to know that nowadays, a woman can pursue her dreams regardless of her education, age, social status, nationality, 
family responsibilities, etc., and that nothing should stop you from growing professionally._

_When I worked at QBE Insurance as an executive assistant, one of my many responsibilities was booking flights for the 
top managers. One day I got a request to book a flight jotted down on piece of paper. I sent all the details to the person who 
requested to make a booking via email, just to get everything confirmed. After I got a confirmation letter, 
I booked the flight. On the day of the flight I realized that the person was still in the office. 
It turned out that she thought a flight was for a different day. She was very upset about with me about this situation. 
Due to my unfortunate overconfidence & lack of communication, I learnt the hard way that it is always a good idea to have 
everything documented and keep records of all the conversations. Even though I sent her a flight confirmation over email, 
it would have helped if I went over the details with her over the phone or, better yet, in person. 
If I encountered this type of situation again, I would save the final copy of the request and not toss it, like I did then. 
I would double-check to make sure the day and time for the booking works for her and probably give her a reminder call 
to discuss any additional details._

_What has changed? For the past year, I feel like I grew a lot since I applied a year ago._
* First: I attended a few events for women who code. 
* Second: I took a beginner java script class with Women Who Code and planning to take their Ruby for beginners in March. 
* Third: I also completed the foundation of computer science class at a local college that included overview and beginner level of 
java script. 
* Fifth: In addition, I took HTML/CSS class. 
* Sixth: It was a good experience to attend Django girls weekend workshop where we build a web page. 
* Lastsly: I am currently watching a course on Udemy for java script language and I really like it.
